# Machine_Learning_Companion

# Overview

This is a project I've been working on. This is an andorid app writen in JAVA and Kotlin. This App uses ab API to search the web for the latest articles on machinelearning and many other topics. This app also has a fully functional login and signup page that links directly with firebase for storage and user authentication. I also have a user page so the user can see their information and upload a profile picture that then get stored and linked in firebase. Also I added google test adds

The purpose of making this software was because I enjoy being up on all the new things with AI but its hard to find and get a curated list of articles on it. So it was something that I thought would be great to have so I made it.
